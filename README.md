Northeastern University Lost and Found
## Synopsis
The ‘Lost and Found’ website aims to provide a platform where a member of Northeastern community
can login with their Northeastern credentials and either post a ‘Found’ request or if they have lost an
article, then a ‘Lost’ request.
## Motivation
Help the Northeastern Community by locating and reporting all types of lost items ranging from husky cards to laptops, keys to bagpacks and even pets, such as cats and dogs.
